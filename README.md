# Master Thesis Research Project  
**Structural Transformation, Diversification Dynamics, and Resource Dependence**

**Reproducible research repository for a Master’s thesis in Applied Economics**

This repository contains the full scientific infrastructure, research architecture, data pipelines, and methodological framework for a Master’s thesis focused on structural transformation and the dynamics of economic diversification under conditions of non-renewable resource dependence.

This is not a document repository — it is a research system designed as a reproducible scientific laboratory, following principles of open science, research governance, and academic reproducibility.

## Core Research Question

> How do the dynamics, speed, and structural patterns of economic diversification differ across economic systems that have historically been dependent on non-renewable natural resources, and which structural mechanisms explain these differences across different regimes of resource dependence?

**Conceptual formulation:**

> *This thesis studies how varying degrees of non-renewable resource dependence shape the trajectories, speed, and structural patterns of economic diversification within economies that have historically followed extractive development paths.*

## Research Focus

### **Central concepts**
- Structural transformation  
- Economic diversification dynamics  
- Speed of productive diversification  
- Resource-dependent economic systems  
- Post-resource (NRD) structural regimes  
- Extractive economic structures  
- Long-run development trajectories  
- Transformation pathways  
- Comparative structural dynamics  

### **Analytical perspective**
The project does not study countries as isolated units.  
It studies **structural economic systems** characterized by different degrees of non-renewable resource dependence **within the universe of historically extractive economies**.

Economic systems are treated as **structural configurations** rather than fixed national categories, allowing economies to transition over time between different regimes of resource dependence.

RD and NRD are understood as **structural regimes** within historically resource-dependent economies, not as global country classifications.

Countries are treated as empirical realizations of structural models, not as the unit of analysis.

## Research Objectives

### **General objective**
To analyze how different degrees of non-renewable resource dependence affect the speed, structure, and dynamics of productive diversification across economic systems with historically extractive development trajectories.

### **Specific objectives**
- Construct dynamic indicators of productive diversification  
- Measure diversification velocity and transformation rates  
- Model degrees of resource dependence as structural conditions  
- Identify structural transformation trajectories within historically extractive economies  
- Classify structural regimes of resource dependence (RD → transitional → NRD)  
- Compare diversification dynamics across different dependence regimes  
- Evaluate structural and institutional correlates of diversification speed  
- Model dynamic transformation processes using econometric tools  
- Analyze regime transitions within extractive development paths

## Methodological Framework

### **Analytical design**
- Structural-comparative approach  
- Dynamic trajectory analysis  
- Transformation path modeling  
- Regime-based structural analysis within extractive economies  
- Non-homogeneous time structures  
- Structural alignment of historical processes  

### **Econometric strategy**
- Dynamic panel modeling  
- Structural panel designs  
- Regime and phase-aligned panels  
- Continuous modeling of resource dependence (non-binary)  
- Endogeneity control  
- Dynamic persistence modeling  
- Structural heterogeneity analysis  
- Robustness and regime sensitivity testing  

### **Temporal logic**
Time is treated as structural time, not calendar time:
- Asynchronous historical trajectories  
- Phase-based temporal alignment  
- Event-based structural timing  
- Regime-based segmentation  
- Relative-time modeling

- World Development Indicators (World Bank)  
- UNCTADstat  
- International Energy Agency (IEA)  
- Penn World Table (PWT)

### **Data philosophy**
- Separation of raw and processed data  
- Deterministic pipelines  
- Reproducible transformations  
- Transparent construction of indicators  
- Versioned datasets  
- Traceable processing flows
