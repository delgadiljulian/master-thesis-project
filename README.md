# Master Thesis Research Project

**Reproducible research repository for a Master’s thesis in Applied Economics**

This repository contains the complete research infrastructure, data pipelines, econometric workflows, and documentation framework for a Master’s thesis focused on productive diversification, energy transition, and economic growth in resource-dependent economies.

The project is designed as a **research lab**, not just a document repository, following reproducible science, open research, and academic governance standards.

## Research Focus

**Core theme:**
- Productive diversification
- Energy transition
- Economic growth
- Macroeconomic volatility
- Resource-dependent economies

**Empirical scope:**
- Cross-country panel data
- Period: 1995–2023
- Focus on emerging and developing economies
- Emphasis on Latin America and resource-rich countries

---

## Research Objectives

- Quantify the impact of productive diversification on economic growth and volatility  
- Evaluate the role of energy transition in macroeconomic stability  
- Model dynamic growth processes using panel econometrics  
- Control for endogeneity, persistence, and structural heterogeneity  
- Provide empirical evidence for development and energy policy design

## Methodological Framework

**Econometrics**
- Dynamic panel models
- Arellano–Bond GMM
- Blundell–Bond System GMM
- Endogeneity control
- Instrumental variable strategies
- Heterogeneity analysis
- Robustness testing

**Data sources**
- World Development Indicators (World Bank)
- UNCTADstat
- International Energy Agency (IEA)
- Penn World Table (PWT)
- External research datasets

## Reproducible Research Design

This repository follows reproducible research principles:

- Separation of raw and processed data
- Deterministic data pipelines
- Script-based transformations
- Versioned modeling workflows
- Reproducible environments
- Transparent governance
- Replication-ready structure
- Journal-compatible organization

---

## Governance and Research Integrity

The project includes formal governance components:

- Research protocol
- Data policy
- Ethics statement
- Versioning strategy
- Reproducibility pipeline
- Documentation standards

This ensures compliance with:
- Academic integrity standards  
- Replicability requirements  
- Open science practices  
- Research transparency principles

## Research Philosophy

This repository is not a thesis document archive.

It is a **scientific research system**:
- Modular  
- Reproducible  
- Scalable  
- Replicable  
- Extendable to academic publications  
- Extendable to PhD research  
- Compatible with journal submission standards  
- Designed as a long-term research platform
