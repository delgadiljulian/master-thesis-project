# Master Thesis Research Project  
**Structural Transformation, Diversification Dynamics, and Resource Dependence**

**Reproducible research repository for a Master’s thesis in Applied Economics**

This repository contains the full scientific infrastructure, research architecture, data pipelines, and methodological framework for a Master’s thesis focused on structural transformation and the dynamics of economic diversification under conditions of non-renewable resource dependence.

This is not a document repository — it is a research system designed as a reproducible scientific laboratory, following principles of open science, research governance, and academic reproducibility.

## Core Research Question

> How do the dynamics, speed, and structural patterns of economic diversification differ between resource-dependent (RD) and non-resource-dependent (NRD) economic systems, and which structural mechanisms explain these differences?

**Conceptual formulation:**

> *This thesis studies how varying degrees of non-renewable resource dependence shape the trajectories, speed, and structural patterns of economic diversification.*

## Research Focus

### **Central concepts**
- Structural transformation  
- Economic diversification dynamics  
- Speed of productive diversification  
- Resource-dependent (RD) economic systems  
- Non-resource-dependent (NRD) economic systems  
- Extractive economic structures  
- Long-run development trajectories  
- Transformation pathways  
- Comparative structural dynamics  

### **Analytical perspective**
The project does not study countries as isolated units.  
It studies **structural economic systems** characterized by different degrees of non-renewable resource dependence.

Economic systems are treated as **structural configurations** rather than fixed national categories, allowing economies to transition over time between different regimes of resource dependence.

Countries are treated as empirical realizations of structural models, not as the unit of analysis.

## Research Objectives

### **General objective**
To analyze how different degrees of non-renewable resource dependence affect the speed, structure, and dynamics of productive diversification across economic systems.

### **Specific objectives**
- Construct dynamic indicators of productive diversification  
- Measure diversification velocity and transformation rates  
- Model degrees of resource dependence as structural conditions  
- Identify structural transformation trajectories under RD and NRD regimes  
- Compare diversification dynamics across different dependence regimes  
- Evaluate structural and institutional correlates of diversification speed  
- Model dynamic transformation processes using econometric tools  
- Analyze regime transitions between RD and NRD structures

## Methodological Framework

### **Analytical design**
- Structural-comparative approach  
- Dynamic trajectory analysis  
- Transformation path modeling  
- Regime-based structural analysis (RD / NRD)  
- Non-homogeneous time structures  
- Structural alignment of historical processes  

### **Econometric strategy**
- Dynamic panel modeling  
- Structural panel designs  
- Regime and phase-aligned panels  
- Continuous modeling of resource dependence (non-binary)  
- Endogeneity control  
- Dynamic persistence modeling  
- Structural heterogeneity analysis  
- Robustness and regime sensitivity testing  

### **Temporal logic**
Time is treated as structural time, not calendar time:
- Asynchronous historical trajectories  
- Phase-based temporal alignment  
- Event-based structural timing  
- Regime-based segmentation  
- Relative-time modeling

## Data Architecture

### **Core data sources**
- World Development Indicators (World Bank)  
- UNCTADstat  
- International Energy Agency (IEA)  
- Penn World Table (PWT)  
- External research datasets  
- Historical economic databases  

### **Data philosophy**
- Separation of raw and processed data  
- Deterministic pipelines  
- Reproducible transformations  
- Transparent construction of indicators  
- Versioned datasets  
- Traceable processing flows
