# Master Thesis Research Project  
**Structural Transformation, Diversification Dynamics, and Non-Renewable Resource Economies**

**Reproducible research repository for a Master’s thesis in Applied Economics**

This repository contains the full scientific infrastructure, research architecture, data pipelines, and methodological framework for a Master’s thesis focused on **structural transformation and the dynamics of economic diversification** in economies based on **non-renewable natural resources**.

This is not a document repository — it is a **research system** designed as a reproducible scientific laboratory, following principles of open science, research governance, and academic reproducibility.

## Core Research Question

> **How does the speed of economic diversification vary across economies highly dependent on non-renewable natural resources, and which structural factors explain these differences?**

**Conceptual formulation:**

> *This thesis studies why some economies based on non-renewable natural resources diversify faster than others.*

---

## Research Focus

### Central concepts
- Structural transformation  
- Economic diversification dynamics  
- Speed of productive diversification  
- Non-renewable resource-based economies  
- Extractive economic models  
- Long-run development trajectories  
- Transformation pathways  
- Comparative structural dynamics  

### Analytical perspective
The project does **not** study countries as isolated units.  
It studies **structural trajectories of transformation** in economies whose productive systems are historically organized around **non-renewable resource extraction**.

Countries are treated as **empirical realizations of structural models**, not as the unit of analysis.

## Research Objectives

### General objective
To analyze the structural factors associated with differences in the **speed of productive diversification** in economies based on non-renewable natural resources.

### Specific objectives
- Construct dynamic indicators of productive diversification  
- Measure diversification velocity and transformation rates  
- Identify structural transformation trajectories  
- Classify models of extractive economic organization  
- Analyze comparative transformation dynamics  
- Evaluate structural and institutional correlates of diversification speed  
- Model dynamic transformation processes using econometric tools

## Methodological Framework

### Analytical design
- Structural-comparative approach  
- Dynamic trajectory analysis  
- Transformation path modeling  
- Regime and phase-based temporal analysis  
- Non-homogeneous time structures  
- Structural alignment of historical processes  

### Econometric strategy
- Dynamic panel modeling  
- Structural panel designs  
- Trajectory-based panel construction  
- Regime and phase-aligned panels  
- Endogeneity control  
- Dynamic persistence modeling  
- Structural heterogeneity analysis  
- Robustness and regime sensitivity testing  

### Temporal logic
Time is treated as **structural time**, not calendar time:
- Asynchronous historical trajectories  
- Phase-based temporal alignment  
- Event-based structural timing  
- Regime-based segmentation  
- Relative-time modeling

## Data Architecture

### Core data sources
- World Development Indicators (World Bank)  
- UNCTADstat  
- International Energy Agency (IEA)  
- Penn World Table (PWT)  
- External research datasets  
- Historical economic databases  

### Data philosophy
- Separation of raw and processed data  
- Deterministic pipelines  
- Reproducible transformations  
- Transparent construction of indicators  
- Versioned datasets  
- Traceable processing flows
